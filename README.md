# Distributed Energy Resources for Swiss Distribution Grids

This repository contains the codebase used to generate the dataset described in [citation], [citation], which provides detailed Distributed Energy Resource (DER) allocations and load profiles across Swiss medium- and low-voltage distribution grids. The scripts and folder structure included here allow users to replicate the creation of DER profiles and their spatial and temporal integration into Switzerland’s distribution networks.

Important: This repository does not include the input datasets, intermediate processing results, or output data files. These can be obtained as outlined in the corresponding article. Scripts provided here enable users to process the input data and reproduce the final outputs.

## 🧠 Methodology Overview
The generation of the high-resolution DER dataset follows a two-step process:

- Data Retrieval and Processing
Input data for DER technologies (PVs, BESSs, EVs, HPs) and non-controllable loads is collected, preprocessed, and temporally standardized. This includes forecasts for 2030, 2040, and 2050.

- Integration into Swiss Distribution Grids
The processed data is geographically and electrically mapped to detailed distribution grid models of Switzerland, including 879 medium-voltage (MV) and 34,920 low-voltage (LV) grids.

## ⚙️ Reproducibility & Execution
Each main module (e.g., PV, BESS, HP, EV, Load) includes Python scripts to:
- Process and format the raw input data
- Allocate resources across the Swiss grid models
- Generate intermediate and final results
Please refer to the how_to_run.txt files (in PV and HP folders) and the .ipynb notebooks for guidance on execution.
