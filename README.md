# Future Deployment and Flexibility of Distributed Energy Resources in the Distribution Grids of Switzerland

This repository contains the codebase used to generate the dataset "Future Deployment and Flexibility of Distributed Energy
Resources in the Distribution Grids of Switzerland", available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15056134. It provides detailed Distributed Energy Resource (DER) allocations and load profiles across Swiss medium- and low-voltage distribution grids. The scripts and folder structure included here allow users to replicate the creation of DER profiles and their spatial and temporal integration into Switzerland’s distribution networks.

Important: This repository does not include the input datasets, intermediate processing results, or output data files. The input data are publicly available, and can be gathered as described in dedicated files in this repository. Intermediate results and outputs can be obtained by running the codes in this repository. Scripts provided here enable users to process the input data and reproduce the final outputs.

## 💡Methodology Overview
The generation of the high-resolution DER dataset follows a two-step process:

- Data Retrieval and Processing:
Input data for DER technologies (PVs, BESSs, EVs, HPs) and non-controllable loads is collected, preprocessed, and temporally standardized. This includes forecasts for 2030, 2040, and 2050.

- Integration into Swiss Distribution Grids:
The processed data is geographically and electrically mapped to detailed distribution grid models of Switzerland, including 879 medium-voltage (MV) and 34,920 low-voltage (LV) grids.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Code
- **Download the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine:
- **Gather Input Files**: Collect the required input files from the sources described in the related paper. Place these files in the appropriate directories as specified in the folder structure and in the scripts. In case of doubt contact the authors of the paper.
- **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have **Python 3.11** or later installed. Then, install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    # Create a new conda environment
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
- **Run the Scripts**: Navigate to the relevant folder and execute the scripts as described in the how_to_run.txt files or the folder-specific instructions below. Please run the scripts in the following folder order: PV -> BESS -> HP -> EV -> LV_basicload -> MV_basicload. Data_checker.py and the scripts in the folders SwissDN_DERs and Plotting_data can be run afterwards.
