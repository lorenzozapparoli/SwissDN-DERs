This folder contains the script EV_allocator.py, which performs the EV allocation and creates the scenarios for 2030,
2040 and 2050. Instructions to run the script are given below.
1) Make sure that the EV input data required for the allocation and scenarios are in the specified path. In particular, download these files form the Zenodo repository https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15194721:
    Municipality_daily_flexible_charging_energy_2050.csv
    Municipality_hourly_charging_power_2050.csv
    Municipality_hourly_lower_charging_power_bound_2050.csv
    Municipality_hourly_upper_charging_power_bound_2050.csv
2) Make sure that the Grids folder is populated with the LV grids.
3) Run the script EV_allocator.py. The script will create the EV allocation for 2030, 2040 and 2050 in the folders SwissDN_DERs/EV/EV_output/2030, SwissDN_DERs/EV/EV_output/2040 and SwissDN_DERs/EV/EV_output/2050.
